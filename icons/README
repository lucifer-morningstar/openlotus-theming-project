## Icons used in OpenLotus theme elements. 

the ./glyphs folder contains basic glyphs and elements basic to making icons. They are all created by me except some of the corprite and commercial software logos.  In those case, the icons were obtained from https://commons.wikimedia.org

All of mine are free to use. Credit would be nice. If you're nice.
